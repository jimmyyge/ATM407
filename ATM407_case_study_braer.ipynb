    "The **Braer storm** was an extratropical cyclone that formed in January 1993 and reached a minimum pressure of 914 hPa, making it the most intense extratropical cyclone ever recorded in the northern Atlantic Ocean. The storm caused the breakup of the stranded oil tanker MV Braer, giving it its name. No human life was lost aboard the Braer but an estimated 1500 seabirds died from the oil spill. On the evening of January 10, parts of the United Kingdom experienced rain, sleet, and snow. A few areas in Scotland reported blizzard conditions, thunderstorms, and gusts over 100 knots.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Braer storm developed around January 8, 1993, as a merger of separate frontal zones off Newfoundland, Canada. The strong temperature gradient and upper-level jet created baroclinic instability, and the storm quickly intensified. The storm reached its maximum intensity of 914 hPa in the afternoon of 10 January while it was south of Iceland, and by that evening, the pressure began to rise. As it tracked to the northeast between Iceland and Scotland, the storm steadily weakened; on January 12, the minimum pressure was 952 hPa. Five days later, on 17 January, the cyclone dissipated in the Norwegian Sea.\n",

    "## Explosive cyclogenesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Explosive cyclogenesis (sometimes referred to as “bombogenesis” or a “weather bomb”) is a rapid deepening of an extratropical cyclone’s central low. Conventionally, the threshold that characterizes explosive cyclogenesis is a decrease of 24 hPa in 24 hours at 60$^\\circ$ latitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **quasi-geostrophic omega equation** is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma \\left( \\nabla^2 + \\frac{f_0^2}{\\sigma} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial p^2} \\right) \\omega = f_0 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p} \\left( \\mathbf{V_g} \\cdot \\nabla \\left( \\zeta_g + f \\right) \\right) + \\nabla^2 \\left( \\mathbf{V_g} \\cdot \\nabla \\left( -\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial p} \\right) \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In extremely simple terms, this equation states that _vertical velocity is proportional to vorticity advection by the thermal wind_.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Q-vector form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma \\left( \\nabla^2 + \\frac{f_0^2}{\\sigma} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial p^2} \\right) \\omega = -2 \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{Q}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\sigma$ is the static stability term. It is immediately apparent that sigma is inversely proportional to vertical motions and so it has a dampening effect, which follows our intuition. Notably, above warm ocean currents, the atmosphere has less static stability and is less resistant to vertical forcing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diabatic heating plays another critical role, as will be discussed later along with potential vorticity. On the eastern side of the cyclone, warm, moist lower-level air rises as it moves polewards, heating the lower troposphere with warm air advection and latent heat release. The sharpened temperature gradient results in an increase of warm advection, which from the Q-G omega equation, implies an increase in upward motion. This greater rate of ascent feeds the baroclinicity and intensifies the cyclone, and the process continues while enforcing itself. This positive feedback loop corresponds to explosive cyclogenesis."

    "Upper level PV anomalies are produced when stratospheric air with PV descends into the upper troposphere. From the conservation of PV, the isentropes distort, bowing in towards a positive anomaly. This is mathematically represented in the $\\left( \\nabla^2 + \\frac{f_0^2}{\\sigma} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial p} \\right) \\chi$ term of the Q-G $\\chi$ equation. If the PV moves eastward with the main flow, adiabatic flow moves westward along the deformed isentropes, causing rising motion downstream and sinking upstream of the anomaly. Lower PV anomalies are produced by low-level temperature advection. If the lower and upper anomalies are \"in phase\" and their circulations extend far enough through the troposphere, they can amplify each other.\n",

Over the east coast of Canada, a strong ridge and associated subsidence caused PV to increase in the upper troposphere.

The PV quantities used in this case study were entirely derived variables that existed in the data. In future work, the notebook may look at other derived quantities such as sounding data, and provide more details on diabatic heating in the storm. Hopefully, there will also be more interaction between the notebook and IDV."
